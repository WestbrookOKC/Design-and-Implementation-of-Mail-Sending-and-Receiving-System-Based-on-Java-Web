# Design-and-Implementation-of-Mail-Sending-and-Receiving-System-Based-on-Java-Web

This document will explain how to design and implement an e-mail sending and receiving system based on JAVA, MySQL, JSP and other technologies. The main analysis and design work includes:

(1) Based on the functional requirements and performance requirements of the e-mail, as well as the knowledge and skills mastered by oneself, the most suitable development environment and development technology are selected.

(2) Referring to major mature e-mail systems and related papers, the flow chart of the main functional modules is constructed, and the E-R diagram of the relationship between major entities is drawn.

(3) The relational table of the database is converted according to the E-R diagram, and the structure and constraint description of the MySQL database table are realized.

(4) Using MVC mode and Jsp technology to design the system in detail, realize the functions of sending and receiving e-mail, and give the key code.

(5) Part of the key functions of the system are tested, and the test results and interface display are given.
